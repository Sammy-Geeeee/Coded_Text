# Text_Cryptographer
This program will encode and decode text in a cryptographic-like manner.
 
 
This program will take a string of input text, as well as some numbers from dropdown lists.
The numbers chosen will perform modifications on the input string, shifting the word order, letter order, changing the characters, etc.

It will then output this modified string in a separate box, the output or input text can then be copied or pasted and passed on.
The program also has a decrypt function that will perform the steps in reverse, also dependant on the numbers chosen, so the message can be decrypted.

There is no great purpose or function for this program, just an idea that I wanted to see if I could implement.
